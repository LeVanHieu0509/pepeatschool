# Million.js Foundation

The Million.js Foundation (Fiscally sponsored by Hack Club â€“ EIN: 81-2908499) is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to stewarding the Million.js project, nurturing the Million.js ecosystem, and supporting the set of maintainers governing and developing the project.

It's important to note that the Million.js Foundation is not legally associated with the Million.js project. The Million.js Foundation is a separate entity from the Million.js project.

Million.js was initially created by [Aiden Bai](https://aiden.mov) in 2021 as a [research project](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3555776.3577683). Since then, it has grown into a community-driven project with over 40 contributors.

## Acknowledgments

Million takes heavy inspiration from the following projects:

- [`blockdom`](https://github.com/ged-odoo/blockdom) ([GÃ©ry Debongnie](https://github.com/ged-odoo))
  Thank you to GÃ©ry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.
- [`voby`](https://github.com/vobyjs/voby) ([Fabio Spampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato))
  The Million.js "template" concept is derived from Voby's `template()` API.
- [Hack the Wave](https://hackthewave.com) ([Melinda Chang](https://github.com/melindachang)) for their homepage.
- [`react`](https://react.dev) and [`turbo`](https://turbo.build) for their documentation. Many parts of the current Million.js documentation are grokked and modified from theirs.
- [`ivi`](https://github.com/localvoid/ivi), [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact), [and more](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2021/table_chrome_96.0.4664.45.html)

Million is being used at companies like [Wyze](https://wyze.com) and [Dimension](https://dimension.dev), as well as open source work like [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), [TinyPages](https://github.com/Borrus-sudo/tinypages), [and more](https://github.com/aidenybai/million/network/dependents).
