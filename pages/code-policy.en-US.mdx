# Code Policy

**Effective Date: February 2024**

Million Software, Inc. (“Million”) recognizes that its customers' code is their proprietary intellectual property, which could cause significant harm to their business if made public or shared with unauthorized parties. Accordingly, this Code Policy sets forth the steps taken by Million to safeguard the confidentiality of the code that is sent to Million servers in the course of using Million's products and services (the “Code Data”).

This policy refers specifically to the code that is uploaded to Million servers by official Million editor extensions. Other user data, including but not limited to customer emails, phone numbers, IP addresses, analytics data relating to use of the Million website, or general metadata collected about customers' usage and traffic patterns, is governed by the Privacy Policy, not the Code Policy.

Million cannot take responsibility for third-party software, even if it uses the Million name or is compatible with the Million API. For the Code Policy to apply, the extension used to access the Million service must be linked from Million's official website at https://million.dev

1.  All Code Data is subject to a 7-day retention policy. Any Code Data that is uploaded to Million servers will be deleted from Million's internal systems within 7 days of the time of upload.
2.  Million does not use Code Data to develop its products and services.
3.  Million does not share Code Data with any third parties except as required by law or as necessary to provide its products and services. For example, Million's internal systems run on Amazon Web Services, and Code Data is stored using systems managed by Amazon. A list of all third party infrastructure providers who may have the ability to access Code Data is available to customers upon request.

Million reserves the right to modify this Code Policy at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
